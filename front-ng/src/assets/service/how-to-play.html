<p><strong>Attention!</strong> When guitar in focus all browser's keyboard's events (hotkeys) are disabled
  and you can't use it. For example, if you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> all text will not be selected,
  or if you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> web page will not be saved.
  But all keyboard's events (hotkeys) of your operation system stay enabled anyway,
  such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> open Task Manager or
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> close the active window in Windows operation system.
  That's why please use complex chords careful or disabled some hotkeys in your operation system.</p>
